     |-----------|----------|
     |type|text|
     |Varible name|`APIHOST`|

7. Go to Deployments and reupload the zip file to make sure the enviroment varible work.

And now, you can request to `your-project-name.pages.dev` and it should return the response from the api host.

## Enviromental varible explanation
|Name|Avalible values|explanation|example|
|----|----------------|------------|-------|
|`APIHOST`|A url|The api url|`example.com/api`|
|`PROTOCOL`|`HTTP` or `HTTPS`|The protocol of the api,This will overide the one you include at the `APIHOST`. However, if you have a valid value for protocol in the `APIHOST` part, then you don't need to set this varible.|`HTTP`|
|`REQUIREHEADERNAME`|a header name, this is case sensitive|If you set this then you must include this header in you request or it will response with `403 invalid request`|password|
|`REQUIREHEADERVALUE`|The password for the header|This is the value for the header you set with `REQUIREHEADERNAME`, if you don't set it then this value is ignored|password|
|`REQUIREPARAMNAME`|a param name|If you set this then you must include a param with a proper value wo use or it will response `403 invalid request`|password|
|`REQUIREPARAMVALUE`|The value for the param|This is the value for the param you set with `REQUIREPARAMNAME`, ignored if the value is not set.|password|
Both header and param set to be required will be remove when sending the request.
If you set to require to then you must include both of them or it won't work.
